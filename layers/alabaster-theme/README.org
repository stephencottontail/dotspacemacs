* Description
  This layer adds support for the Alabaster theme, inspired by [[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tonksy.theme-alabaster][Nikita Prokopov's VSCode theme of the same name]] and [[https://github.com/jameslintaylor/alabaster-theme][James Lin Taylor's Emacs port.]]

** Features:
  - Alabaster deliberately highlights only things the parser could reliably identify. If highlighting is unreliable, your brain must take precious extra seconds to double-check what it sees.
  - Along those same lines, Alabaster deliberately avoids the "fireworks" effect of some other themes by only highlighting four classes: strings, statically-known constants, comments, and global definitions.
  - Unlike most themes, Alabaster highlights comments; if the code was complex enough to require an explanation, then that explanation should be prominently displayed.

* Install
